# digital-clock
This is a real-time digital clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock dynamically displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, updating every second. The design is responsive and visually appealing, making it suitable for websites and dashboards. The project demonstrates my skills in JavaScript DOM manipulation, real-time updates, and frontend development. Future enhancements may include dark mode, different time formats (12-hour/24-hour), and customizable themes.
